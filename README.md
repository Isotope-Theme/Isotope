# Isotope

Isotope is a color scheme based in mathematics. Taking inspiration from Ethan
Schoonover's [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/). I have
engeneerd this colorscheme with a focus on the CIELAB lightness relations, the
contrast ratios of the colors, and the color relations of the selected hues.
